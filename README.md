Model 1: Content Based Recommendation System : A Content-Based Recommendation System is a type of recommendation system that suggests items to users based on the features or characteristics of the items themselves, rather than user behavior or interactions (which is the case in collaborative filtering). The system analyzes the content or attributes of the items and recommends similar items that match the user's past preferences.

Model 2: Context Based Recommendation System: Description-based recommendation uses the textual content of movie descriptions to find similarities between movies. It compares the description of a given movie with others using techniques like TF-IDF and cosine similarity to quantify how similar they are. The system then suggests the top 10 movies with the most similar descriptions to the input movie.
